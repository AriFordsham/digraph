[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kadena-io/digraph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kadena-io/digraph)

Directed graphs in adjacency set representation. The implementation is based
on `Data.HashMap.Strict` and `Data.HashSet` from the [unordered-containers
package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unordered-containers).

Undirected graphs are represented as symmetric, irreflexive directed graphs.
